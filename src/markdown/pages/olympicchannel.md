I only built a small amount of this one because of a holiday I so rudely booked into the middle of production - but it is really cool I can say I've worked on a project for the Olympics.

This was the first project I had built at Kerve using Gatsby. The main reason for that was the inclusion of 3 games that we built in React. These were lazy loaded in once they come into the viewport, keeping page size minimal and otherwise static.

The holiday meant I only had time to set up the project and some basic features, and then build the games when I got back. The rest of the site was built by other staff at Kerve. It was an interesting build however, and I was very impressed with how easy it was to work with Gatsby in this context.
