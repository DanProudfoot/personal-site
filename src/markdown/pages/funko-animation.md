Funko Animation Studios are the animation arm of the massive toy company Funko, famous for their popular (heh) "Pop" figures.

A bit of casual nepotism got me the role as developer when the studio's previous incarnation got bought out by Funko.

What results is a small and snappy site that focuses its attention on the client's most important needs - Show off the studio's fun and whimsical nature, and offer a jobs board that the company was previously missing.

The Gatsby underpinning allow more sections to be added quickly when I'm called on again.
