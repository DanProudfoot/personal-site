The Big one. A massive project for a big client. We were tasked with building all of the in-store interactive displays for the rollout of the "Vype Inspiration" stores across the UK, Germany and Poland for British American Tobacco

My position was basically lead on the structure of web shell. Across 5 "digital touchpoints" there was a tonne of shared components, so I ended up building the data fetching logic, the screen layout and container setup and a lot of the shared components. This gave the rest of the team a powerful base to build a couple of touchpoints each. I then went about figuring out how to administrate a large amount of Android tablets and display TVs

All said and done it was a massive project, and pretty incredible that we got it done in 8 weeks. We quickly launched in one store in the UK, then rolled out to 7 more UK stores. Then rolled out to Germany and Poland. All within the space of 3 months.
