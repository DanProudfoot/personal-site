One I'm really proud of but sadly didn't see its full potential.

Haagen-Dazs wanted to run an ice cream delivery system at Wimbledon in 2018. Eventually that had to be scaled back because they couldn't get permission to run it there. In the end we ran a smaller scale run at Russell Square in London. The test went really well and we thought it would become something a bit bigger...but it never went forward.

The app itself was really cool though. Other team members built an admin interface and a facebook chatbot that accepted orders. I then built two apps - one for the deliverers and one that launched out of the facebook chat session.

The facebook side of things would ping the user's precise GPS location to the server, and that would be displayed on the deliverers device so they could track them perfectly. The deliverers app did the same in reverse - sending their location to the patiently waiting user.

The deliverers app also had a list of orders coming in live with accept and decline functions. Accepting an order would prevent any other deliverer coming in and also accepting it.
