I’m Dan. I’m a Front End Developer based in Bath, UK.

I currently work at Kerve where I build websites, React apps and do installations for big clients like Huawei.

## That's not all, of course!

<br />

I’ve helped build campaign sites for the Olympic Channel, circuitry for Leapfrog, product customisation for NARS and Laura Mercier and almost a trillion other things.
