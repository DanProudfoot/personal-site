I’m <em>Dan</em>, a Front End Developer based in Bath, UK.

I currently work at [Kerve](https://kerve.co.uk) where I build websites, React apps and do installations for big clients like Huawei.

<br />

I do a <em> bit of everything really:</em> I’ve helped build the in-store display software for BAT, campaign sites for  Olympic Channel, circuitry for Leapfrog, product customisation for NARS and Laura Mercier and almost a trillion other things.
